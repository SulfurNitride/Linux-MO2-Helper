A Bash script I made with DeepSeek and Claude that should work with all major Linux distros that sets up mod manager downloads for MO2 in Proton, and installs _almost_ all dependencies for the modlists you make via Protontricks.

The script can be run by piping directly to Bash
```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SulfurNitride/Linux-MO2-Helper/refs/heads/main/mo2helper.sh)
```
Alternatively, you may run this script by downloading a local copy
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SulfurNitride/Linux-MO2-Helper.git
cd Linux-MO2-Helper
bash ./mo2helper.sh
```
